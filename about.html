                    Organization  will try to do  many different things in order to attain these goals. 

 

For example, It will  hold a weekly "Combination" meeting where it will  bring together diverse groups of young people to explore cultural, racial, and sexual issues. But also it will be involved in many aspects of youth's lives, and offers opportunities for leadership development and guidance for both education and careers.

Young people will  transform feelings and experiences about youth issues into music, dance, and drama. They will  perform their skits in their neighborhoods and at schools, community centers, and prisons. They will  perform on stage, and some of their works will be developed into videos and shown on television to send a positive message to youths throughout the community.
